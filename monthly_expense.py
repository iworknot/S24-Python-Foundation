"""
We will create a program to track our monthly expenses.


The git will be used as a "database". For example, we will update the salary, take the output from console 
and save it in the same file.
After each function execution, manually update the value in file, commit and push to github.

Future improvement:
1) Use classes and objects. How the globle variable will be used in the class?
2) Once we learn file i/o or some api or database, we will replace the manual steps
